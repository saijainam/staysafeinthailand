### WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE STOPPED BY IMMIGRATION OFFICERS 

_Itâ€™s the job of the Thai authorities to keep people safe in the Kingdom and to ensure that only people with the right to be in Thailand are present. That means they have the duty to follow up on anything they might think is suspicious or out of order. The guidelines that follow are designed as a help for any interactions with the authorities and for the benefit of all concerned._

* *Remain calm, polite, and cooperative*: If approached by immigration officers, stay calm and maintain a cooperative attitude. It's essential to create a positive and respectful interaction, even if you feel apprehensive or anxious. Remember that being polite and respectful can often help de-escalate the situation.Â 
* Present your documents when requested: When asked to show your documents, present them as requested. Ensure you have your passport, visa, and any other relevant identification readily available.Â 
* Assert your visa status if questioned: If the officers question your presence or visa status, calmly assert that you are in Thailand based on the visa you possess. Provide any relevant documentation to support your claim. However, avoid engaging in arguments or becoming confrontational. Politely state the facts and let the officers carry out their duties.Â 
* Refrain from allowing access to your phone without a legal basis: Immigration officers generally do not have the right to check the contents of your phone without a proper legal basis. If they request to search your phone, politely ask them for the specific legal grounds that justify this action. If there is no legitimate reason, you can respectfully decline their request.
* Avoid unnecessary disclosures: While being cooperative, it's important to be cautious about sharing personal information beyond what is necessary. You have the right to privacy and are not obliged to disclose personal details such as your address, phone number, information about other people, or work-related information unless it is specifically required by law or a legitimate immigration request.




### IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

* There is no need to pay fees to the police.
* The police do not have the right to check your phone. You do not need to give them your mobile phone.
* Be aware that there could be a person pretending to be an officer from the immigration office or from a visa application center asking for money. They might tell you to send money as soon as possible. 


### WHAT TO DO IF IMMIGRATION OFFICERS ARREST YOU

* If detained by Thai police immigration, ensure that they provide valid grounds for your detention.
* Be aware of the maximum detention period allowed under Thai immigration law 48 hours initially, extendable up to seven days. 
* If your detention exceeds the allowed period (seven days), know that the official must apply to the Court for an order to further detain you.
* Understand that the Court will assess the necessity of further detention and may order it for a maximum period of twelve days at each application.
* In some cases, the Court may decide that temporary release is appropriate, allowing you to be released from detention.

### TIPS ON STAYING SAFE

1. Maintain a low profile: It is important to minimize your visibility and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself. This includes being cautious about sharing personal information and limiting public exposure on social media platforms.

2. Be cautious when visiting Burmese restaurants or bars: While it's important to support your community, it's also crucial to be mindful of potential risks.

3. Build a trusted network: Establish connections with trusted individuals and organizations so that you could receive information about the situation in Chiang Mai and Mae Sot. 

3. Stay informed about local laws and regulations: Familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations in Thailand, particularly those related to immigration law (See link below on Thai immigration law)

4. Secure communication channels: Utilize encrypted messaging apps and other secure communication tools when communicating with your colleagues and friends to protect sensitive information. 

5. Vary your routines: Avoid establishing predictable routines that could make you vulnerable to surveillance or targeting. Change your routes, meeting locations, and daily activities regularly to reduce the chances of being tracked or monitored.

6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be compromised, so avoid using them for any sensitive communications or accessing personal accounts. If necessary, use a virtual private network (VPN) to add an extra layer of security.

7. Assess your digital footprint: Regularly review your online presence and remove or limit personal information that could be used against you. Be mindful of the digital trail you leave behind and take steps to protect your online identity. Don't keep information that could be sensitive for you or others on your devices. 


8. Develop a safety plan: Create a comprehensive safety plan that includes emergency contacts, safe meeting places, and protocols to follow in case of threats or harassment. Do your friends know what to do if you're out of touch for XX time? Are there things that are also useful to carry with you just in case? This may only be money but also perhaps medicines for those who need them.


Remember, these tips are intended to provide general guidance. Each situation is unique, so it's essential to assess the specific risks you may face and adapt these suggestions accordingly. Stay vigilant, prioritize your safety, and seek assistance whenever necessary.
